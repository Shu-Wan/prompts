# LaTeX Formatting Rules

When providing LaTeX code, please adhere to the following rules:

You must follow the formatting and syntax rules below when asked to provide LaTeX code:

1. Do not use any special whitespace characters to represent a space (e.g., no \u00A0, &nbsp;, or \ ). Use standard space characters only.
2. Use LaTeX syntax for all formatting. Do not use Markdown. For example, use \textbf{...} instead of **...**.
3. Enclose inline mathematical expressions using single $, e.g., $a + b = c$, do not use \(\).
4. Enclose equation using double dollar sign $$ or using \begin{equation}, instead of \[\]
5. Always provide LaTeX code inside a code block.
